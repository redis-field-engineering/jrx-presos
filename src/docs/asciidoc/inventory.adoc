== Real-Time Inventory

[%step]
* Qu'est-ce que c'est?
* Solution
* Demo

== Inventory

*What* is available *Where*

[%step]
* *What:* Products
* *Where:* Stores and DCs

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* A product might have many SKUs (the same shirt has different SKUs for size/color/style combinations). Some retailers reference 1M+ SKUs
* Distribution Center AKA Fulfillment Center AKA Warehouse
--

== Inventory Consumers

[%step]
* e-Commerce
* Find/Reserve in Store
* Order Sourcing
* Store Allocation

== Item Availability

[%step]
* Buckets for supply & demand tracking
* What's really available?
* *Available to Promise (ATP)*: Supply - Demand

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* How do we decide if we can show a piece of inventory as available on the website?
* Factors: on hand (actual inventory), price, product, store, sales velocity, cost to fulfill, order status, laws and regulations, location
--

== Business Benefits

[%step]
* Omni-channel view
* Optimize inventory and supply-chain
* Yield management

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Omni-channel
** Consistency across channels (mobile, web, stores, ...)
** Enables ship to/from store, find-In-Store, Reserve-In-Store, Buy-Online-&-Pickup-in-Store
*** Democratizes inventory based on geographic availability instead of local store only (example -Â  all stores within a 25 mile radius)
*** Avoids opportunity cost of missed sales (in-stock somewhere)
*** Optimizes order fulfillment / shipping costs
* Inventory and supply-chain management
** Forecasting to rely on real-time data instead of historical
** Reduces excess inventory costs and unnecessary shipping
* Yield Management
** allocate inventory to highest margin locations
** Send inventory to the right store at the right time at the right price
* Nationalize order fulfillment
** Unified inventory: geo-clustered stores & DCs
** Re-route fulfillment in natural events (hurricane supplies)

== Inventory Challenges

[%step]
* Performance: volume & velocity
* Accuracy: geo-distribution

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Volume: 1000 Stores * 100,1000 SKUS => 100M Store/SKU combinations
* Velocity: 1000s inventory updates/sec
* Geo-Distribution: maintain consistency between store(s) and data centers

== Performance

== Inventory Inaccuracy

[%step]
* Poor customer experience
* Shopping cart abandonment
* Reduced brand-loyalty
* Remediation: refund, waiting list, cancellation, ...

== Real-Time Inventory with Redis Enterprise

[%step]
* High Performance
* Linear scalability
* High Availability 

== Wait, there's more!

[%step]
* Bi-directional consistency
* Multi-model: no tech sprawl

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Brewdis: 3500 Stores worldwide, 30,000 SKUs
* Product Catalog: full text + secondary indexing (tag, numeric, geo)
* Item availability: what is available and where? geo filters
* Real-Time Inventory: streaming store/sku updates
