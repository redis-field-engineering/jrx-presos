== What is a Time Series?

series of *data points* ordered by *time*
[.text-right]
most commonly sequence taken at successive equally-spaced points in time.

== Time Series in Redis

The traditional way:

* Sorted Sets & Hashes
* Streams

== What is missing?

* Enhanced queries: Labeling
+
`sensor_id:2, cpu:8, area:5`
* Downsampling (compaction)
* Enhanced queries: Aggregation
+
`avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first, last`

== RedisTimeSeries Basics

image::logo.svg[float=left,width=100px]

* Each key is a time series
* Each key can have any set of labels
* Each key can have multiple *downsampling* rules
+
Each downsampling rule will write to a different key

== Create a new time series

[source,shell]
----
TS.CREATE key [RETENTION retentionSecs] [LABELS field value]
----
* `key`: Key name for timeseries
* `retentionSecs`: Maximum age for samples
* `labels`: set of key-value pairs that represent metadata labels

.Example
[source,shell]
----
TS.CREATE ts:2 RETENTION 0 LABELS sensor_id 2 type temperature
----

[.notes]
****
* `retentionSecs`: When set to `0` the series is not trimmed at all
* `labels`: Each Key can have any set of labels
+
Used for multi time-series queries (`TS.MRANGE`)
****

== Append a new value to the series

[source,shell]
----
TS.ADD key timestamp value
---- 
* `timestamp`: epoch timestamp (in seconds) or `*` for automatic timestamp (using the system clock)
* `value`: Sample numeric data value (double)

.Examples
[source,shell]
----
TS.ADD ts:2 1548149181 30
TS.ADD ts:2 * 30
----

== Aggregation, Compaction, Downsampling

```
TS.CREATERULE sourceKey destKey AGGREGATION aggType bucketSizeSeconds
```

* `sourceKey`: Key name for source time series
* `destKey`: Key name for destination time series
* `aggType`: Aggregation type: `avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first, last`
* `bucketSizeSeconds`: Time bucket for aggregation in seconds

[.notes]
****
* `destKey` should be of a timeseries type, and should be created before TS.CREATERULE is called
****

== Delete Rule

```
TS.DELETERULE sourceKey destKey
```

.Examples
```
TS.CREATERULE ts:2 ts:avg:2 AGGREGATION avg 60
TS.DELETERULE ts:2 ts:avg:2
```

== Downsampling

Raw data

== Downsampling

Downsampled and aggregated using average
