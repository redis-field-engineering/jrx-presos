== Data Lifecycle

=== Create a Schema
Using four types:
* Text
* Numeric
* Tag
* Geospatial

=== Add documents
* directly
* from hash
* index only

=== Search/Aggregate
* Search
* Aggregate
* Delete documents as needed
* Drop the whole index

== Query Language

=== Goals
* Intentionally not SQL
* Familiar
* Exposable to end-users

=== Simple
No knowledge of data structures needed

=== Powerful
With knowledge, zero in on data

=== Simple Word Matching
`ford`

=== Prefix Matching
`ford | chev*`

=== Negation
`(ford | chev*) -explorer`

=== Optional Term
`(ford | chev*) -explorer ~truck`

=== Numeric Filter
`@year:[2001 2011]`

=== Geo Filter
`@location:[-77.02 38.78 10 mi]`

=== Tag Filter
`@condition:{good | very good}`

=== Full Query
[%hardbreaks]
`(ford | chev*) -explorer ~truck`
`@year:[2001 2011]`
`@location:[-77.02 38.78 10 mi]`
`@condition:{good | very good}`


== Full-Text Search

=== Stop Words
"a fox in the woods" -> "fox woods"

=== Stemming
"going" -> "going" "go" "gone"

=== Slop 
"glass pitcher", slop 2 -> "glass gallon beer pitcher"

=== With or without content
"To be or not to be" -> Hamlet (without the whole play)

=== Matched text highlight
"To be or not to be" -> <b>To be, or not to be</b> that is the question

=== Synonyms
"Bob" -> Find documents with "Robert"

=== Spell Check
"a fxo in the woods" -> Did you mean "a fox in the woods"

=== Phonetic Search
"John Smith" -> "Jon Smyth"

=== Weights & Scores
* Each field can have a weight which influences the rank in the returned result
* Each document can have a score to influence rank

=== Scoring Functions
* Default: TF-IDF
** Variant: DOCNORM
** Variant: BM25
* DISMAX (Solr’s default)
* DOCSCORE
* HAMMING for binary payloads

== Aggregations

=== !
* Process/transform 
* Same query language as search
* Can group, sort and apply transformations
* Follows pipeline of composable actions

=== Aggregation Pipeline
image::aggregations.svg[]

=== Grouping
[.reducers]
|===
| COUNT | COUNT_DISTINCT | COUNT_DISTINCTISH
|===

|===
|SUM |MIN |MAX |AVG |STDDEV |QUANTILE
|===

|===
|TOLIST |FIRST_VALUE |RANDOM_SAMPLE
|===

=== Functions -- Strings
`substr(upper('hello'),0,3)`

-> `HEL`

=== Functions -- Numbers
`sqrt(log(foo) * floor(@bar/baz)) + (3^@qaz % 6)`

=== Functions -- Time
`timefmt(@time, "%b %d %Y %H:%M”)`

-> `Feb 24 2018 00:05`

=== Aggregate Command

[source,sql]
----
FT.AGGREGATE shipments "@box_area:[300 +inf]"
	APPLY "year(@shipment_timestamp / 1000)" AS shipment_year
	GROUPBY 1 @shipment_year REDUCE COUNT 0 AS shipment_count
	SORTBY 2 @shipment_count DESC
	LIMIT 0 3
	APPLY "format(\"%sk+ Shipments\",floor(@shipment_count / 1000))"
          AS shipment_count
----

== Auto-complete

=== !
* aka Suggestions
* in the module but separate storage

=== Radix Tree-based

Optimized for real-time, as-you-type completions

image::radix.svg[background=DCDCDC]

=== Simple API
* `FT.SUGADD` -- add a suggestion
* `FT.SUGGET` -- get a suggestion
* `FT.SUGDEL` -- delete a suggestion

== RediSearch vs Elasticsearch

=== Indexing Performance

image::benchmark-indexing.png[]

[.notes]
****
* Indexed 5.6 million docs (5.3GB) from Wikipedia
* RediSearch built its index in 221 seconds versus 349 seconds for Elasticsearch, or 58% faster.
****

=== Querying Performance

image::benchmark-querying.png[]

[.notes]
****
* two-word search queries using 32 clients running on a dedicated load-generator server
* RediSearch throughput reached 12.5K ops/sec compared to 3.1K ops/sec with Elasticsearch, or x4 faster
* RediSearch latency was slightly better, at 8msec on average compared to 10msec with Elasticsearch
